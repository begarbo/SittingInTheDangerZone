    <string name="instructions">LAUNCH! THAT! APP!\n
\nSo you’ve decided to step into the DANGER ZONE?! You’re so brave. Now that you’ve set your name, it’s time to understand the DANGER.
    You can walk at any time by selecting the WALK option on the main screen. Choose how long you’d like to walk, and we’ll load a random
    DANGER ZONE SCENARIO for you to escape from — or try! \n
\nDANGER ZONE will randomly prompt you with a sudden DANGER ZONE SCENARIO throughout the day! To disable this option, select the GEAR on the main page, where you can opt out of this feature. \n
\nOnce running, you’ll have the displayed amount of time to ESCAPE FROM THE DANGER ZONE! Track your steps and progress, earn achievements, compete against your friends, AND MORE! All while avoiding spending too much time sitting at your couch or desk!\n
\nCan you escape… the DANGER ZONE??</string>

        Notes on why we did things the way we did:\n
        - We decided not to add moving images to the app as we did not want people to be staring at
        the screen while they were out for a walk and risk getting injured. This app is first and
        foremost a fitness app that is trying to be more interesting than a pedometer, so it is not
        a game that you have to constantly look at the screen for.\n
        - We did not implement app wide volume controls as we felt most users manage sound at a global
        level on their devices for sensitive situations. An example of such a situation would be at the movies
        or during a meeting. Most people would turn off their phones completely, put them on silent, etc.
